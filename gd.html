        <h4>A little bit about my Graphic Design and the Software I use to create my masterpieces.</h4>
        <p>I make a lot of designs (usually horrible ones) but I'm getting better! I started Graphic Designing back in May of 2020 because I wanted things for my stream and didn't want to pay tons of money to have a good looking stream so I made my own overlays, alerts, logo, emotes and sub badges. People said they liked my designs and wanted me to make them all something similar, so I did. They were very happy with their design as was I. Now I just experiemt and use what works. Nothing super intersting but that's how I came upon Graphic Designing!</p>

        <h4>A few facts about my passion for Graphic Design and the things I use to pursue that passion.</h4>
        <p>I started Graphic Designing in late May of 2020, I'm not entirely sure why but we'll go with it. I continued this interest of mine and found it to be quite fun. I then began making stream emotes, sub badges and overlays for myself and others. Some people began asking me to create some designs for their streams. As I did so, it turns out people appreciated my work so I carried on designing things for other people and here we are. Not a super interesting story but it's how I discovered the world of digital art!<p>
